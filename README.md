# Natural-Language-Processin

In this repository, you will find a collection of Python files and lab documents that cover various NLP experiments. These experiments are designed to give you a hands-on understanding of the techniques and methods used in natural language processing.

The Python files in this repository cover a wide range of topics, from text preprocessing, tokenization, word embeddings, bag of words, stemming, lemmatization, POS Tagging and language model. Each file is well-commented and comes with a corresponding lab document that provides a detailed explanation of the code and the concepts covered in the experiment.

To get started, simply download the repository and run the Python files on your local machine. You will need to have a basic understanding of Python and NLP to fully appreciate the experiments.

I hope that you find the experiments in this repository to be both informative and enjoyable. Happy experimenting!
